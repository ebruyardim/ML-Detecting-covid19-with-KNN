# ML-Detecting-covid19-with-KNN
In this project, I detected type CXR images for covid, viral pneumonia and normal. For this purpose, firstly I extracted the features in the images. Then, I splited data into folds as validation and train data. After that, using KNN and Weighted KNN algorithms, I wrote program to predict type of validation data.

The data contains 300 sample of CXR images.
